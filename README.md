# Neighborhood-Map-of-Stavanger

<p>This project displays a map of the city Stavanger with a predetermined 
selection of dining places. Each selection is pinned on the map, 
and clicking the pin gives more information.</p>

program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).</p>
